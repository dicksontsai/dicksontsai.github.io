# Questions and rules from my slides
Thinking about these questions (and writing their answers down on paper) 
  before you code will save you a lot of time.
These questions are not meant to be memorized.
They are to help guide you (e.g. show you some things to think about) initially 
  until you build a correct intuition.
Recommended: practice with these step-by-step, saying everything explicitly
Disclaimer: These questions are in no way "official". See lecture, lab, and 
  discussion for official notes.

# Iteration Qs
1. What do you want to repeat in your loop?
2. What vars do you want to keep track of? What should each var start with?
3. When should the loop stop? What to do w/ resulting values? 

# Function characteristics from lecture (do this for all functions, especially HOFs)
1. Domain - set of all inputs the func might take as args
  * Can be specific albeit not usually, e.g. 3-digit prime numbers
2. Behavior - relationship between input and output. 
  * What does this function do between getting called & return?
3. Range - set of output values it might possibly return.
  * Again, can be specific.

# Recursion Qs
1. What is the desired behavior of your function?
2. What vars do you want to keep track of? (Input)
  a. Remember that your return value holds values too!
  b. If you have more than # of params + 1 (RV can hold info too), 
     you need to define helper
  c. Where should each var start?
3. How can I reuse the function with smaller input?
4. How do I combine the result with the current info (parameters) to solve the problem?
5. Base cases: When should we stop? What to return?
6. Does the return value match the function's range everywhere? In base case? Recursive call?

Creating a function using def/lambda: (e.g. lambda x: lambda y: x + y)
----------------------------
1. Draw `func <name>(<param1>, <param2>, ...) [parent=?]`
2. The parent of the function is the current frame
3. For def only: bind this function to the same name in the current frame

Calling user-defined functions: (Anything with (), e.g. square(5))
---------------------------
1. Evaluate the operator and operands. All of them.
2. Create a new frame. Label the frame with the info from the function
object: <name> [parent=?]
3. Bind the formal parameters to the arguments (values of operands)
4. Evaluate the body with new frame as current frame
5. Return back to the frame that called the function

Assignment (e.g. a = 5)
----------
1. Evaluate all expressions on the RHS 
2. Bind name(s) on LHS to value(s) on RHS in current frame

Binding something to a name (e.g. a ---> func a(x) [parent=Global]
---------------------
1. If the value is a primitive, you can just write it next to the name.
2. If the value is an object, draw an arrow to that object in the heap.

Name Lookup (e.g. square, a)
------
1. Start at current frame. If name is there, great! If not, go to the
parent frame. 
2. Keep going until you cannot find the name in the global frame.
