<h1>How I'll run labs</h1> 

<ol>
  <li>Demo for the whole class (5 mins), usually on logistics like submitting assignments, setting up.</li>
  <li>Pair programming will be enforced. The pairs themselves can change throughout lab.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Great chance to help others out!</li>
    <li>Great chance to get to know people, especially those working on the same problem.</li>
    <li>Great chance to communicate!</li>
  </ul>
  <li>I will run little 'seminars' (maybe one easy, one advanced) that students can choose to listen/ignore.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Show how I would approach a problem.</li>
    <li>For experienced students, show what more they can explore on a certain topic.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Hope students approach lab as something fun and rigorous, as opposed to a mere requirement.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Experienced students can help out less experienced students.</li>
    <li>Students can build something extra using the topic they learned/extra libraries.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Nice, relaxed atmosphere</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Lab assistants and I can participate in the learning with the students, offering followup questions (both conceptual and problem based) along the way.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>

<h1>How I'll run discussions</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Warm-up</li>
  <li>Discuss why we are studying what we're studying. Applications. Real-life analogies.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Students should come somewhat prepared for more engaging discussion. Not going to be enforced.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Detailed walkthrough of simple example.</li>
  <li>Easy problems solved in groups. Everyone (somewhat prepared) should be on the same page by the end.</li>
  <li>Discussion of a difficult problem. What do you know? What approaches should we try? How can we divide this problem into simpler problems?</li>
  <li>Usually, I'll leave the other difficult problems for students to take home. </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Rushing a difficult problem is pointless. I'm just going to give the solution.</li>
    <li>We don't have to finish the whole discussion packet. It'll leave you with few paper questions to do at home.</li>
    <li>5 years from now, what will/should you remember? That abstraction is like buying things in a supermarket, or that the answer to #4.3 involves printing before the recursive call?</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Breaktime. Working nonstop is unproductive. Humans get tired.</li>
  <li>Rinse and repeat. Total focus while discussing.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Dos and Don'ts of Discussion</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Please come a little bit prepared (know what lecture was about, did some reading)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>It's ok to not fully understand something. Come with questions!</li>
    <li>If in a rush, block off 30 mins of your day, and go through the slides/reading. Come up with simple examples. That's all the prep you need.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Please do NOT come to discussion looking for me to explain all the answers.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The solutions are posted online.</li>
    <li>Goal: know the concept well enough to be able to explain the solution to yourself.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Please share some of your funny, CS-related experiences in life.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>e.g. Yesterday, I took a picture of a picture of me taking a picture!</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Please see discussion as something fun!</li>
  <li>Please give me feedback :)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Random thoughts on learning</h1>
<h2>Best way to learn? Look at how children acquire language</h2>
There are a few really cool observations about children one can make:

<ol>
  <li>Babies spend all of their time learning language. They are not expected to that many other things.</li>
  <li>Babies don't learn complex sentences first. They learn words first.</li>
  <li>Babies make mistakes &mdash; lots of them.</li>
  <li>Parents/caretakers are usually there to give instant feedback for those mistakes.</li>
  <li>Babies hear lots of data. If no one talks to babies, they do not develop language skills.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How to apply these observation at the college level</h3>
<ol>
  <li>College students are more pressed for time, but if one has to learn something well, incorporate CS more. Beyond class, make stuff with others on the side. It's a nice social activity as well.</li>
  <li>Start simple. There's no reason to tackle something hard if you're not ready. You need to know the tools you are working with inside/out.</li>
  <li>Don't feel like you have to be perfect on the first go. Don't get discouraged when you get something wrong. Keep working at it. Also, explore!</li>
  <li>Python and Google searching gives instant feedback. So do your peers doing CS with you in Berkeley.</li>
  <li>Do lots of practice problems. Invent practice problems for each other. They don't have to be hard.</li>
</ol>

<h1>My Summer 2014 TA Bio: What is your teaching style?</h1>

<p>
  I personally learn best first by learning the rules very deeply.
  My favorite analogy: if you want to be good at shooting a basketball, at the very least,
  you can try to make your shot straight. Master that task, then move on. 
</p>

<p>
  Then after practicing a lot, start to form an intuition that will 
  hopefully guide me through more difficult problems. 
  Back to the analogy: Once you can confidently shoot the ball straight all the time,
  you don't have to worry about that aspect as much. 
</p>

<p>
  Thus, I expect my sections to be a bit mechanical at the beginning, 
  where I present lots of easy problems. If one gets bored of easy problems,
  aim for speed and accuracy, then try to write out your intuition. 
</p>

<p>
  It's only after one gets enough practice that s/he gets to see the patterns to guide intuition. 
  It's how babies acquire languages really fast. Language is part of their life. You can make
  programming part of yours as well. Programming's not just for school. You can totally socialize and code.
</p>

<p>
  I also like to be informal and easygoing, so expect a lot of trivia and talk about life along the way.
</p>
