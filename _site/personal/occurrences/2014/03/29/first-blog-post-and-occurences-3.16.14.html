			<p>Hi everyone! This is my first blog post for my 3rd or fourth blog I believe, but I’m pretty sure I’ll be more motivated to maintain this one, because my own reputation is on the line here.</p>

<p>Anyway, my blog will have a mix of technical content, my observations on language (you hear a lot of linguistic data walking through a campus of 30,000 students!), and my personal accounts of the week called “Occurrences”. This idea comes from <a href='http://jamesmaa.com'>James Maa</a>’s “Highlights” (which he told me was based off someone else’s idea), where I basically recount two (or a lot more) positive things that happen during my day. If you know me well, who knows? You might appear on the list someday! If you are just here for non-personal information, just check out the “language”, “ideas”, “studies”, or “tech” tags once I start writing for them.</p>

<p>Without further ado, here are my occurrences for the week.</p>

<h2 id="3162014">3/16/2014</h2>

<ul>
<li>My mom and sister came over, and I decided to introduce them to Joshu-ya. (Secretly, I haven’t gone in a few months, so it was nice to finally get to eat there). The food was amazing, like amaaaazing. It was always nice seeing my family too!</li>

<li>We won our IM Ultimate Frisbee game! I did much better this week, outsmarting my defender by reading the frisbee flight path better and leaping over him for a touchdown. I also panicked less, cutting down on the turnovers. That game felt really good.</li>

<li>Project project project. Work work work.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3172014">3/17/2014</h2>

<ul>
<li>I accidentally arranged my UPE family meeting at the same time as my UPE officer meeting… Oops. In preparation for that meeting, I bought each member boba, which didn’t really cost that much at all. Everyone in James Fox (different James) and my family seemed pretty happy, so that’s good to see.</li>

<li>Project 2 for the computer security course is now complete!!! James was an awesome partner once again, but he was busy today so I helped complete the write-ups at the Foothill Academic Student Center (ASC), where he was working his shift as an assistant.</li>

<li>Speaking of the ASC, which is next to the Foothill dining hall, James and I got the Flapjack Mac from late night, a large pancake, eggs, and cheese for only $2.50! It was a pretty good deal, I felt.</li>

<li>Right after I turned in my project, I proceeded to play 2048, and I was in prime position to win the game when James stepped in to make sure I didn’t mess up. I did it! Well, everyone in the ASC must have looked at me weirdly as I celebrated. In the process I might have accidentally gotten James’ co-worker Fanny hooked to the game… Sorry about that!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3182014">3/18/2014</h2>

<ul>
<li>Tuesday was a relaxing day, now that I have turned in the project and only one midterm remains. i.e. I tried to be productive, but the weather was too nice. It was a sunny, high 60s day, with a light breeze. What more can one ask for?</li>

<li>Momo Day was later that night, and after dinner, Sarah and I went to Soda, where she finished working on her project with her partner Gerald. Needless to say, I probably spread the 2048 virus to both of them as well xD</li>

<li>I promised myself that I’d sleep earlier but I didn’t. Well Kelly called me out on talking to her/sleeping late, which is a good thing. I’m glad she’s looking out for me and saving me from my laziness. Such a hero ^_^!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3192014">3/19/2014</h2>

<ul>
<li>Earlier in the day, I studied for the linguistics midterm with Haylie and Jason in the linguistics lounge, and I came up with a difficult sentence to diagram: “Who had been hit with the ball yesterday?”, which I would have asked if I were a TA. I think the creativity of language makes it fun to study. Anyway, it was pretty fun yet productive studying with them!</li>

<li>Flag football reffing from 6 - 10. There was one forfeit, so I only had to work 3 games instead. Underhill (the field)’s restroom is really gross, but Unit 1 is just across, with basement access to the new building and a rarely-used restroom! I think that’s all I’ll say about the restroom.</li>

<li>The games themselves went through really nicely. I think I was pretty much on top of all the calls, which is quite rare given my attention span xD</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3202014">3/20/2014</h2>

<ul>
<li>Syntax study session for the midterm on Friday! It was quite a change finally getting to know linguistics people and not just CS people coincidentially taking linguistics: they have an incredibly different approach to college that was refreshing, in a sense, where they also mix in general life talk as well while studying.</li>

<li>I went to a really insightful design workshop hosted by Hackers@Berkeley and Lever! (and they served Bongo Burger!) There I also saw Jackie, who designed an alarm app with a larger snooze button because I wasn’t very familiar with iOS 7. Yes, I now know that it’s just a tap in iOS 7</li>

<li>During the middle, I took pictures of the GM for UPE, and I happened to take a really coincidential photo of Jennifer (you can see on my Facebook). She proceeded to chase me (for fun of course) while some of the other officers acted as bodyguards. I managed to slip through the back of the auditorium and back to the 4th floor, where the design workshop was. All in all, it was a really weird but interesting experience…running with a photo.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3212014">3/21/2014</h2>

<ul>
<li>Took my syntax midterm today, which was not bad at all. It’s a good feeling when you know it’s easy and you know where people might get tripped up.</li>

<li>Afterwards, it was just chillin’. I first spent my awkward hour gap from 10 to (when the shops actually open = 11) talking to Haylie after the test. It was really cool getting to know her better, because even though we are both linguistics majors, our backgrounds are, in fact, really different.</li>

<li>Spanish class. My professor ended the class early because she knew everyone wanted to go on break. As we were walking out, she asked me if the class was too easy, given that I had taken a linguistics class before. Of course, I replied “yes, but I like Spanish”</li>

<li>I met Joey, my EECS friend who’s taking the same two linguistics classes I’m taking, later in the day. He said that the midterm was even easier than our computer security midterm (median 94/100, bottom quartile 87, top quartile cutoff 97, just for context). We’ll see what happens after break.</li>

<li>I arranged to get dinner at Montague’s (a really good sandwich shop in Southside) and ride home on BART with Sarah. She had leftovers to take care of, so I ended up playing 2048 while waiting for her, and I really felt that I finally understood how the game worked. Well, once we did meet and boarded BART, she gave me very valuable advice about my website design, which you probably just saw for yourself. Our convo definitely made the trip feel a lot shorter, which was really amazing!</li>

<li>Once we arrived, I happened to see Eddy and Afreen, who both are from MV and are at Berkeley, walking from the station. What a coincidence!</li>

<li>Back home, I finally get good Wi-Fi (as opposed to fighting for bandwidth in my apartment), so I had a nice, substantive talk with Kelly over Google Hangouts. She’s my source to all MV news, and I, of course, love to hear news. Specifically, it was about Chamber Orchestra, which reminded me of my old days in that orchestra class where I actually met Kelly for reals. It’s great to be back home!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3222014">3/22/2014</h2>

<ul>
<li>We just finished moving from my old house next to MV to a rental house still in Cupertino. It was an all-day effort, but much credit is due to the movers who had to deal with the heavy furniture. They finished all of it in just about 4 hours!</li>

<li>Speaking of the new rental house, it is quite nice, with more space and a backyard!</li>

<li>I had PMT from Verde, half-sugar. I’m definitely at home. There’s a new drink shop called TPumps that’s really popular, but it doesn’t seem worth the wait to me. Maybe one can call it the C.R.E.A.M. of Cupertino</li>

<li>Tiffany threw my new frisbee over the backyard fence… But the rate at which she learned to throw the forehand was unprecedented… Maybe I’m a good teacher? :]</li>

<li>No Wi-Fi in the new place however, but Chrome kept a cached copy of 2048 to my delight. I got 2048 4 times and 4096 twice, so my observations from Friday seemed to apply really well.</li>

<li>Talked to Kelly over the phone this time. I was tired, so I don’t remember what I talked about, but it was still really fun!</li>
