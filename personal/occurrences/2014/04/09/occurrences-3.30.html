			<p>Hello again! I had a pretty interesting weekend at Big Hack, and I actually wrote a separate blog post about it that was supposed to go on BerkeleyByte…well, I finished yesterday afternoon, and I still haven’t received a response about that story being up. Either way, I shall catch up with my occurrences right now, and hopefully have an idea post coming out soon!</p>

<h2 id="33014">3/30/14</h2>

<ul>
<li>Now back in Berkeley, I spent most of the day studying for my midterm on Tuesday. There was definitely a change in pace as opposed to a regular school day. Northside was really pleasant around lunchtime, as quiet as a needle? (Man, I need to get better similes)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="33114">3/31/14</h2>

<ul>
<li>Today was quite another regular day with a lot of classes to attend, but I was finially able to finish most of my probability homework problems before office hours. It was also pretty cool seeing everyone again. There was a lot to catch up on after break ended.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4114">4/1/14</h2>

<ul>
<li>Happy April Fools’ Day. The only major prank I suffered was the probability midterm because of all the matrices involved (most of our homework problems only involved one dimension). I also (this is speaking after the fact, I know my results) misread some of the problem, losing a few more points than I wanted, but other than that, it seemed like I did understand the material decently. This website took most of my time, but I guess I’m willing to make that tradeoff, to get some of both.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4214">4/2/14</h2>

<ul>
<li>Olivia did the nicest thing today, so I felt really compelled to share. After I left my umbrella and jacket in my discussion room, she saw the things and brought them to the Linguistics undergraduate advisor, which was at least a 5-minute walk from that room. She even talled me later to let me know about my lost items! Really thankful for her thoughtfulness.</li>

<li>Today was the final round of flag football reffing in the regular season. Most teams didn’t show up, so I actually played a game for the first time. It was more painful than I anticipated, since it was very possible to get your leg hit or whatnot but it was actually kind of fun. I did O-line/D-line since I couldn’t throw or catch (or run) for my life, so that was the perfect spot for me. But yeah, I’d never join a team – reffing is fine for me.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4314">4/3/14</h2>

<ul>
<li>In my office hours, quite a few officers visited in preparation for the CS161 midterm, and there was also a person that Jennifer brought over for tutoring…only that no one showed up looking for tutoring help. I ended up recommending everyone to play Set, which I thought was kind of nerdy but still very fun. I definitely had the app installed last week, so I practiced a little, not to James’ extent.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4414">4/4/14</h2>

<ul>
<li>There was some serious cramming that I did for the exam today, and well, it sort of worked. It turned out that the networking questions were rather easy, whereas the cryptography questions were much harder. The exam itself was quite long, so many people had trouble finishing. Either way though, I’m glad that exam is finally done. No more exams until finals for computer security!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4514">4/5/14</h2>

<ul>
<li>After a 1.5 hour bus ride, I finally arrived at Stanford! We were located in the engineering building for Big Hack, and man, I haven’t explored that part of the Stanford campus before but it was absolutely beautiful, not to mention all the conference rooms in that building (so much so that they could use Greek letters to name the rooms).</li>

<li>Well my original Matlab project didn’t work out since I was missing a toolbox. There was quite some interesting goodies at the hackathon though, including Pocky sticks and midnight burrito snacks. Somehow, 4-foot burrito was actually really good. Stay tuned for more hackathon details!</li>

<li>Of course, talking to Kelly from Stanford gave me some more inspiration. While I actually didn’t end up using the ideas she proposed, her presence did give me something to work off of, a game that I can show you guys very soon!</li>
