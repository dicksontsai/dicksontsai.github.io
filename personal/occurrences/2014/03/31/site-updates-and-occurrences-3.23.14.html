			<p>Hi everyone! I have a probability midterm tomorrow, so this will be a short post to keep the push for content until I have more time later in the week. But just to update – my site is nearly done, with the only major component missing being the projects page. Hopefully, I can create another project at Big Hack or HackFSM in the next few days to make the page more interesting. Either way, here are the occurrences from my spring break:</p>

<h2 id="32314">3/23/14</h2>

<ul>
<li>It’s Sunday! I think we made a Costco run, where I (sort of) made sure that we got raspberries. We also ate at Sweet Tomatoes, which I like especially for their chicken noodle soup and the Asian-y salad at the very beginning? Peole who’ve been there definitely know what I’m talking about.</li>

<li>I believe I taught my sister how to throw the frisbee using a forehand today (or maybe it was yesterday, I don’t remember). She learned really fast, but then proceeded to throw the frisbee over the fence to our neighbors house. To this day (one week later), I think the frisbee is still there. Oh well. Either way, she now has the skills to join the MV Ultimate Frisbee club and maybe find herself a date to senior ball.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="32414">3/24/14</h2>

<ul>
<li>The AT&amp;T guy game here to install our Internet. We are finally moving out of the dark ages! But anyway, it’s quite remarkable how much life is different without internet on my computer, but at the same time, I was able to find other ways to entertain myself and not get things done (phone, cached copy of 2048, …).</li>

<li>I really couldn’t think of anything else that happened today, but I believe my website coding was in full swing after seeing 3 commits to GitHub on this day. I started collecting some of my favorite photographs, most of which were from Spain. It was such a nice experience, and you can see my <a href='/about'>About Me</a> page for more info about my trip.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="32514">3/25/14</h2>

<ul>
<li>I picked up Kelly and Tiffany to go to Little Mongolian Hot Pot, and the food was good as usual. I was especially glad that we ordered the tofu pods, because they quickly became my favorite. The spicy food was still a bit too hot to handle, but oh well xD.</li>

<li>Afterwards, Kelly was able to tour our new rented house. As always, it was nice hanging out with her. It has been literally a month since I last saw her, and well, we both forgot to mention why today was special, but I guess we were just glad to see each other again. I actually spent 4 whole days in Cupertino without meeting her so yeah patience paid off here!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="32614">3/26/14</h2>

<ul>
<li>Today was the South Bay Taqueria Hangout! It was pretty cool to see all the same Berkeley peeps (in no particular order) Jon, Albert, Robert, Sarah, Jeremy, and Elizabeth at the same place. Many thanks to everyone: Jon for spending time despite having to work (he doesn’t get a spring break), Jeremy and Elizabeth for driving all the way down from Berkeley just to hang out with us, Sarah for the ride, and Albert and Robert for coming for their first time. Wow I included everyone!</li>

<li>Well, during the day, I did the bulk of my grading and also worked on my website somewhat. Working on my website was actually really interesting, because I really had to re-familiarize myself with CSS especially (oh the horror of having to follow responsive design, which was moot because my linguistic skyline in my <a href='/'>homepage</a> wouldn’t behave properly). Either way, I’ve really enjoyed this endeavor!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="32714">3/27/14</h2>

<ul>
<li>I went up to Mission Peak with James and Jennifer today, and it was quite an amazing experience. First off, it just rained the last two days, so the hills were a really beautiful green color. Images are on Facebook, but I also saved one for the About Me page. We took the shorter route, so I was more tired at the top than the last time I went with Kelly and Michelle, but the beauty and clear skies (no smog after the rain) really made up for it. The peak was really cold though, so we took our pictures and then left very soon. During the hike, I was able to help guide a couple, who were there for their first time, in the right direction. They were about to go downhill away from the peak, so it was nice seeing them enjoy their time at the peak.</li>

<li>Afterwards, James drove Jennifer and me to pick up Kelly, who got into Cal today! Wow! Anyway, we went to the Boiling Crab, where I got a bag of shrimp and some fried calamari/sweet potato fries. Needless to say, everything was really tasty, and many thanks to James for driving everywhere, and to Jennifer for delighting Kelly with her avocado gelato.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="32814">3/28/14</h2>

<ul>
<li>I drove to Palo Alto to work on the 161 homework with James. I was still really tired from yesterday, so I wasn’t thinking as clearly (somehow thinking about adding probabilities everywhere where I should’ve done hash-table related collision-failure probability). We did go to a really good place called Sancho’s Taqueria, and there James and I talked about random things such as his soccer career and athletes’ performance in clutch situations.</li>

<li>I believe I finished grading a homework set, thank goodness! These homework sets take a long time to grade, but on the bright side, I suddenly feel very comfortable explaining RSA and public key encryption in general. I just wish that I could be faster at grading while providing the same quality of feedback. We shall see next week.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="32914">3/29/14</h2>

<ul>
<li>It’s really sad that today would be my last day at home. My parents were really nice and hospitable the entire time, so many thanks to them! I especially enjoyed the raspberries, which I really wanted to eat at Berkeley but never got the chance to buy. We also went to a pretty good Korean place Kong Tofu for some tofu soup before heading back to Berkeley.</li>

<li>Earlier in the day, I had Curry House with Kelly and a hangout at my place – a really nice way to cap the week. We did wait a long time because Curry House had a 20% off coupon, but I felt it was well worth the wait. I would say that this spring break, while not the most productive, was very enjoyable. Website, one homework set, and (lots of 2048 games xP) complete!</li>
